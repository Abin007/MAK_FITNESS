# MAK_FITNESS
creating a registration page for new customers at the GYM.

This a registration i made in my free time for gym trainer for easy registration for new customers.
I did it on MAC OS . So it probably won't work on Windows
It uses FLASK server as a local host. It uses python in the back-end.

you have to install flask . paste these files in the respective places you've installed and replace the folders with same name .

Then start the flask server and go to the localhost home page and you're set!!
